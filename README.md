# Knight's Travails
Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms)

The aim of the project is to find the simplest way to get from one square to another, and output all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

Sample output: <br>
````
> knight_moves([3,3], [4,3])
=> You made it in 3 moves! Here's your path:
[3,3]
[4,5]
[2,4]
[4,3]
````
